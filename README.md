This project is a small Bank Management System where the user can manage customers and their information.

Main Features

At the start, the program displays a main menu with six options:

View Customers

Add a New Customer

Delete a Customer

Update Customer Information

Find/Search for a Customer

Exit

Each option is selected by entering a number from 1 to 6.

Customer Information

Each customer has the following details:

Account Number

PIN Code

Customer Name

Phone Number

Balance

All customer data is stored in a .txt file for persistence.

How It Works

When the user selects an option, the program executes the corresponding action.

After completing an action, the user can return to the main menu by pressing Enter.

Choosing the Exit option will close the program.
